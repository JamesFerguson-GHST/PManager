To use it is quite simple, create an account with a username and paassword, login using the same credentials , and start uploading your passwords. these passwords will be encrypted until the user presses the "view passwords button", which will display them all. The user can merge these passwords with a json file of other passwords and can then download the new JSON file directly to their device. There is a light/dark mode togglee which changes the theme to your liking and if you ever want to clear your passwords from your account simply click the delete passwords and confirm.
